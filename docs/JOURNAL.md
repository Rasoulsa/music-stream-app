# 📔 Development Journal

This journal records the step-by-step progress of the Music Stream App.

The purpose is to document technical decisions, learning progress, problems, and solutions.

## Day 1 — June 05, 2026

### What I did

- Defined the project idea: online music streaming/player app
- Decided to use Django for backend development
- Decided to use React with TypeScript for frontend development
- Decided to use Docker and Docker Compose throughout the project
- Decided to include tests from early stages
- Decided to deploy first on a VPS, then move toward cloud/AWS later
- Created the initial project structure
- Added `.gitignore`
- Added `.env.example`
- Added initial `README.md`
- Started the development journal

### Technical decisions

- VPS first is chosen to build strong Linux, Docker, deployment, and server fundamentals
- AWS/cloud will be added later after the app is stable
- TypeScript will be used in the frontend from the beginning
- Tests will be part of the project, not an afterthought
- GitHub will be used as the public contribution and progress platform

### What I learned

- Why `.env` should never be committed
- Why `.env.example` is useful for documenting required environment variables
- Why a clean GitHub history matters for a portfolio project
- Why building and documenting step by step is valuable for job search

### Next step

- Initialize the Django backend
- Add Django REST Framework
- Configure pytest
- Create the first backend test
